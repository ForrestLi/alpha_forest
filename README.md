iii) Utilize human discretion to conduct additional research.

iv) Apply machine learning techniques (e.g. random forest, finrl) to train pricing features such as Bollinger Bands, 
moving average, mean-reversion related indicators (bias), other technical indicators (KDJ, RSI), and Markov-related patterns
